Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list with each iteration. While bubble sort is easy to understand and implement, it is not efficient for large lists due to its time complexity of O(n^2).
