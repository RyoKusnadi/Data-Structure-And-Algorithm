A Queue is an ordered data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. 

Push: Adding an element to the end of the queue.
Pop: Removing and returning the element from the front of the queue.
Peek: Returning the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checking if the queue is empty.
Length: Returning the number of elements currently in the queue.

NB: Adding Lock So It's Thread Safe
